Since C provides a minimalist set of built-in features, I created this library to make certain tasks more convenient and to enhance my own workflow.
 My main goal was to add practical tools and new data structures that aren't part of the standard library, making my development experience in C a bit easier and more efficient.

## Dependencies

- C compiler: Works fine in both clang and gcc
- GNU Make: To build the library
- Bash: Running installation script

## Features

- Priority Queue (pq.h): This priority queue is built using a binary heap and provides an efficient way to manage elements with priorities

## Installation

### Linux

```bash
./install
```
### MacOS

```bash
./install
```
### Windows

Install WSL and goto [Linux](#linux)
